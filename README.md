All in one program!

## Workflow

This tool is intended to be used in this workflow:
- Open SonoUtils
- Download a .mp3 from YouTube
- Make a chart using chart editor of choice
- Open the custom server and configure it according to the console-based GUI
- Start the server and record a white / black BG gameplay (needed for Sono-Overlay)
- Shut down the custom server and then swap to Sono-Overlay
- Download the .mp4 file
- Use Sono-Overlay to get the overlay using the server (launched in background)
- If missing requirements: Use Sono-Aviutl (downloads all necessary requirements)
- Use AviUtl2 to edit your video

This tool should speed up testing by orders of magnitude!
